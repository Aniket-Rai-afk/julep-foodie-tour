# 🍽️ Foodie Tour Planner with Julep AI

Hi there! 👋

Hi there! 👋

This project was created as part of my assignment for the **Founder's Office Role @Julep AI**. As someone just starting out, I was excited to explore a real-world use case — and Julep made it incredibly smooth.

Using Julep's no-code platform, I built an agent that plans a full foodie tour across selected cities, taking into account the **local weather**, **famous dishes**, and **popular restaurants** — all without writing backend code or calling external APIs. 🚀

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal was to build an AI agent that:
- Takes a **list of cities**
- Fetches the **current weather**
- Suggests **indoor or outdoor dining**
- Picks **3 iconic local dishes per city**
- Recommends **top-rated restaurants**
- Crafts a delightful **one-day foodie tour** including:
  - 🥞 Breakfast
  - 🍛 Lunch
  - 🍽️ Dinner
